## Stories
## Part 1

* As a user, when I start the app, I should see a list of different topics on which to take a quiz. (For now, these should be hard-coded to read "Math", "Physics", and "Marvel Super Heroes", as well as any additional topics you feel like adding into the mix.)  

* As a user, when I select a topic from the list, it should take me to the "topic overview" page, which displays a brief description of this topic, the total number of questions in this topic, and a "Begin" button taking me to the first question.  

* As a user, when I press the "Begin" button from the topic overview page, it should take me to the first question page, which will consist of a question (TextView), four radio buttons each of which consist of one answer, and a "Submit" button.  

* As a user, when I am on a question page and I press the "Submit" button, if no radio button is selected, it should do nothing. If a radio button is checked, it should take me to the "answer" page. (Ideally, the Submit button should not be visible until a radio button is selected.)  

* As a user, when I am on the "answer" page, it should display the answer I gave, the correct answer, and tell me the total number of correct vs incorrect answers so far ("You have 5 out of 9 correct"), and display a "Next" button taking me to the next question page, or else display a "Finish" button if that is the last question in the topic.  

* As a user, when I am on the "answer" page, and it is the last question of the topic, the "Finish" button should take me back to the first topic-list page, so that I can take a new quiz.  

## Part 2
* As a developer, the "topic overview", "question" and "answer" pages should be merged into a single Activity, using Fragments to swap between the question UI and the answer UI. This means, then, that there will be only two Activities in the entire system: the list of topics at the front of the application, and the multi-use activity that serves for the topic overview, the question, and answer pages.

1pt: Topic Overview uses fragment  
1pt: Question uses fragment  
1pt: Answer uses fragment  
2pts: Two activities
